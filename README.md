ECG Image Classification with PyTorch

 Project Description
This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify Electrocardiogram (ECG) images into different categories of heart conditions. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable classifier that can assist in the preliminary analysis of ECG visuals.

Project Components
Code: The full project code, including data loading, model architecture, training loops, and evaluation metrics, is available in a Jupyter Notebook.
Model:A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the dataset. The trained model weights are stored in the `ecg_classifier_model.pth` file.
Dataset: The image dataset used for training and testing the model is hosted on Kaggle.
